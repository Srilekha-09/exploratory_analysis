PROBLEM

In the fast-moving, effort-intense environment that the average person inhabits, It’s a frequent occurrence that one is too tired to fix oneself a home-cooked meal. And of course, even if one gets home-cooked meals every day, it is not unusual to want to go out for a good meal every once in a while for social/recreational purposes. Either way, it’s a commonly understood idea that regardless of where one lives, the food one eats is an important aspect of the lifestyle one leads. Now, imagine a scenario where a person has newly moved into a new location. They already have certain preferences, certain tastes. It would save both the student and the food providers a lot of hassle if the student lived close to their preferred outlets. Convenience means better sales, and saved time for the customer. Food delivery apps aside, managers of restaurant chains and hotels can also leverage this information.

IDEA

This project involves the use of K-Means Clustering to find the best accommodation for students in Bangalore (or any other city of your choice) by classifying accommodation for incoming students on the basis of their preferences on amenities, budget and proximity to the location.Implementing the project will take you through the daily life of a data science engineer - from data preparation on real-life datasets, to visualising the data and running machine learning algorithms, to presenting the results.It will perform 6 tasks-• Fetch Datasets from the relevant locations (Data Collection) • Clean the Datasets to prepare them for analysis. (Data Cleaning via Pandas) • Visualise the data using boxplots. (Using Matplotlib /Seaborn /Pandas) • Fetch Geolocational Data from the Foursquare API. (REST APIs) • Use K-Means Clustering to cluster the locations (Using ScikitLearn) • Present findings on a map. (Using Folium/Seaborn)We took IIT bombay map for analysis.

OBSERVATIONS

1)Cluster 0 (Green) has more restaurents but less gyms and cafes.

2)Cluster 1 (Orange) has maximum restaurents,gyms and cafes.

3)Cluster 2 (Red) has less cafes but more gyms and restaurents
